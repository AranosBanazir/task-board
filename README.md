# Task Board

## Description
This task board allows you to add tasks, track their status, and remove tasks that have been finished or are no longer relavent. Tasks will be color coded based on the current date in relation to the given due date. Being able to track tasks will give you a visual representation of things that need done, while offering an easy way to manipulate the status of the tasks. All tasks will be saved in localStorage allowing them to be saved between sessions on the browser.

When dragged to the 'Done' lane all tasks will display with the same styling as the depicted 'On Time' task.

To delete a task hit the delete button on the individual task, this will remove the task from localStorage, and clear it from your task board.
